simply and directly I believe we shouldconsider adopting some form of nationalservice no not a return to the militarydraft something entirely different and,Society,0.49
completely new for us national servicein its fullest meaning my reasons haveto do mostly with what I see as anurgent need to address the growing stateof disconnection we have in our country,Society,0.668
today but it is based also on mypersonal experiences which flow directlyfrom something else I did on mygraduation day fifty years agobesides listening to a man in a red tie,Society,0.646

three years and a much better person andeven commencement speaker now fiftyyears later the bottom line for me onthis is simply this whatever theultimate conclusion I believe,Humanities,0.471
passionately that we would all benefitfrom a full and frank discussion of ourmutual responsibilities to serve of thejoys and satisfactions that come from,Society,0.323
such service from lifting ourselves awayfrom our own needs just for a whileto pay attention to those of others andof trying to find a way that involves,Travel,0.403
