20 years ago the Federal CommunicationsCommittee abolished the long-standingFairness Doctrine that requiredbroadcast media to give equal time todivergent views on public issues in the
years sense the budgets and broadcasttime allotted for hard news reportinghave contracted severely at the sametime that their news audiences havegrown older some voices warned that the
segmentation of media may make it tooeasy for Americans to hear just theviews they want to hear rather than thefacts they may need to hear publictelevisions news hour with Jim Lehrer

objectivity and intelligence have earnedthe trust of millions of viewersI am indeed honored to welcome ourcommencement day speaker dr. Jim Blairthank you
as the single freshest graduate ofHarvard Universityremember how is the last one to get infact I'm so fresh I still have my robeon and that makes me the most recent new
member of the Harvard Alumni AssociationI would like to say to Larry Summersthat on behalf of everybody in this roomand everybody associated with our school
we accept your challenge and we willmake it happen sirI don't know about you all you probablyused to this but I was really impressedwith the rundown on the financial
condition but that aside on behalf ofthe nine of us who received honorarydegrees today we as a group would liketo pledge to begin the new the new group
of the class of 2006 we would as a grouplike to pledge 127 billion dollarsgo way beyond Alston way beyond Austinthis is truly a great day for mepersonally in fact in the words of my
three year three-year-old granddaughterwho is here Olivia this is what shewould call a hoot and holler day for mein the morningI am awarded an honorary degree and now
as the commencement speaker I had theopportunity to cause second thoughts foreverybody who had anything to do withwhat happened this morning and I thought
I would make those folks particularlynervous by beginning with the bus callyou heard several references thismorning to the fact that I have a busbackground and that bus background
includes in the 1950s I worked as aticket agent in the continentalTrailways bus depot and a place calledVictoria in South Texas and one of myduties was to do this into a microphone
may I have your attention pleasethis is your last call for continentalTrailways 8-10 p.m. silversides airconditioned through liner to Houston nowliving from lane wall piranhas at not
the night all the way they'll KimboPierce Wharton Honda pretend to beRosenberg Richmond Sugar Land StaffordMissouri City and Houstonall aboard don't forget your baggage
please now you may be asking what in theworld does that have to do with anythingthat's happening here today first of allI try very hard to include to include a
bus call in every speech I make for goodluck the second thing it does serve areal purpose this afternoon kind of 50years ago almost of this very day Ireceived my undergraduate degree in
college the commencement speaker was aman who wore the gaudiest red tie I hadever seen in my life and he wore itbecause he said he wanted us the classof 1956 to remember him he said nobody
in their right mind particularly thosegraduating listens to commencementspeeches so you won't remember anythingI say you won't remember my name or even
what I look like but maybe you willremember this awful red tie well I'vejust proven him correctI remembered the tie he was also right Idid not remember his name and I did not
remember what he looked likebut he was wrong about one veryimportant thing I did remember what hesaid more or less I paraphrase fromvague memory since you will not remember
a word I say I have chosen to say verylittlegood luck in your life from this dayforward try to be kind to one and to alland to yourselfthanks for the honorary degree and have
a great afternoonhe gave us a little nod and then hereturned to his seat as you can imaginetwo great and thunderous and thankfulapplause and so since you will not
remember a word I'd say I have no suchluckno thankful applause right now but inkeeping with the man's basic principlesof commencement addresses I promise not
to keep you longand here comes the purpose and think ofthe bus call as my equivalent to his redtie something to remember me byjournalism is that my law is my line of
work and is at the heart of why I amstanding here today but the kind ofbroadcast journalism we do on theNewsHour is the ultimate ultimatecollaborative enterprise as I suggested
at a Shorenstein Center Kennedy schoolevent here a few weeks ago gettingpretty faces like mine on and off theair takes villages of talentedprofessionals thus whatever honors come
to me including those of today I acceptthem always for them as well as me alsohonored in my case are some guidelinesthat I also shared with that earlier
Harvard audience they are my personalones that we use at the NewsHour and ourpractice of journalism I wrote them downseveral years ago at the behest of a
seminar being held at the AspenInstitute do nothing I cannot defendcover write and present every story witha care I would want if the story wereabout me soon there is at least one
other side or version toevery story assume the viewer is assmart and as caring and as good a personas I am assume the same about all peopleon whom I report assumed personal lives
are a private matter until a legitimateturn in the story absolutely mandatesotherwise carefully separate opinion andanalysis from straight news stories and
clearly label everythingdo not use anonymous sources or blindquotes except on rare and monumentaloccasions no one should ever be allowedto attack another anonymously and
finallyfinally I am NOT in the entertainmentbusinessI have come with only one majorcommencement like point to make you'llbe delighted to hear and let me put it
simply and directly I believe we shouldconsider adopting some form of nationalservice no not a return to the militarydraft something entirely different and
completely new for us national servicein its fullest meaning my reasons haveto do mostly with what I see as anurgent need to address the growing stateof disconnection we have in our country
today but it is based also on mypersonal experiences which flow directlyfrom something else I did on mygraduation day fifty years agobesides listening to a man in a red tie
speak I went with my parents from thecommencement ceremony to a building oncampus and I raised my right hand andwas sworn in as a second lieutenant inthe United States Marine Corps I spent
the next three years as an infantryofficer mostly in the Far East it wasbetween the Korean and Vietnam warsI saw no combat fired no rounds in angerhad none fired at me had no roadside
bombs kill fellow Marines of mine I wasspared events like that that might havetriggered losing control to going overthe top of civilized behavior into angry
barbarism as has been charged to give agroup of Marines these days in Iraq butmy marine service was a life-changingexperience for me a positive one that
had I not had I most likely would not bestanding here today because I would notbe a person deemed worthy for such anhonor I went into the military because I
had to join on your own or be draftedwas the choice I chose the Marines forpersonal not heroic or as you canclearly see physique reasonsmy dad had been a Marine and so had my
brother so I would be a Marine thatrequired service changed me and the lifeI have led ever since my travels up tillthen had been restricted pretty much to
central Kansas eastern Oklahoma andSouth Texas my mode of transport wasmostly on Trailways buses but as amarine I took my first plane ride toWashington DC and then on eventually to
California and to Japan and to Okinawaand to Taiwan and to the Philippines andto essentially the world my friends andaquaintances up till then had been
mostly people who looked talked andthought like me but now I was eatingdrinking sleeping sweating and runningup down running up and down hills withand listening to and depending on people
who had little in common with me somespoke and looked different most werelarger and stronger than me a fewsmaller some were smarter others dumbersome were rich others poor some were
wonderful people others were less sosome wouldn't hurt a fly otherssometimes deserve to be hurt by flies inthat diverse company I learned to beresponsible for others I learned to
depend on others and to understand whatbeing dependent on by others reallymeant I learned that there was more tothe world than me and my kind that there
was more to my life than me me me and meI learned there was joy and satisfactionto be had by looking past the mirror byserving common interests rather than
only those of self I am grateful mycountry forced me to serve my countrynot for my country's sake but for my ownmy three years of service connected meto the rest of the world the world
outside myself and the connection hasbeen permanent the experience alsoleft me with a firm conviction thatbeyond the benefits to individualsconnecting and connections are essential
for our democratic society to work andspeaking now as a journalist whose jobit's been to pay attention to suchthings I have never seen us moredisconnected from each other than we are
right now we are splintering off intosegments interest groups lobbies targetaudiences blogs boxes our racialcultural and religious differencesalways our great strengths have become
an instrument in our great disconnectionour growing economic differences asLarry's put it brilliantly are feedingthis our politics at the moment actually
seem to be encouraging it and ourotherwise terrific explosion and newmedia outlets for information and debateare helping facilitate it I believe whatwe need is a new hard real world dose of
shared experience we had one after 9/11and it drifted awaywe had one after Katrina and it wentaway we have yet to even have one onIraq a show of hands please in this room
how many of you know someone personallywho has served or is now serving in Iraqhow many of you know a person or arelative of a person who has been killed
or wounded in Iraq raise your hand ifour being at war in Iraq has had anydirect effect on your life at all what'sleft I believe for us all the issues of
the war in Iraq aside how do we connectourselves ourselves and then stayconnected to the other Americans who doserve in the military and elsewhere inour name on our behalf
without having to sustain a tremendousman-made or natural disasterI would submit one way is in factservice itself service in all of itsmany forms service that could mean the
Peace Corps a teacher Corps aConservation Corps a police Corps ahospital Aid Corps a tutor Corps a bigsister big brother Corps a coping Corpsthey pick up the trash Corps as well as
the Marine Corps I do not have aspecific 10 or 12 point proposal to puton the table I am a journalist not aproposal Asst but I do have some framingquestions for the discussion in order to
be fair should it be mandatory noexemptions no permanent defermentseveryone eventually serves should itapply across the board men and women allphysical and intellectual sizes and
abilities included what should be theage parameters should there be a way toinvolve not just the young should it beconstructed around choices eachindividual choosing the form of service
military or specific civilian he or shewishes should it be developed inpartnership with private and corporateresources as well as governmental shouldit be tied to a GI bill type program
service earns education home and otherbenefits in addition to the benefits ofconnection and of the soul I know somewill argue that such a program would
cost too much I would only ask comparedto what others would argueothers would argue that it for it toreally work politically it must bevoluntary I don't do politics so I'll
leave the politics of national serviceto someone else but voluntary service iswhat we have now the result to myobservation at least it may be cheaperbut it's also a serious causing a
serious heightening of our differencesand our disconnections and definitelynot just as it involves the military myguess is that all of you in this room
alums students parents whatever have aninterest in volunteer public service andthat you have no doubt already done someof it and will always continue to do so
am I right about that yes absolutely noquestion about it but voluntaryvolunteer service voluntary service thekinds that you perform and the kindsthat I perform is not an equal
opportunity operation non-militaryvolunteerism is pretty well confined tothe well-educated and the well-off themajority of Americans are simply not infinancial in a financial position to
delay careers to take no pay internshipsto take off a year or two or even a fewweeks or even a long weekend to do goodto help people rebuild their homes in
New Orleans or Indonesia do tutoring oflow-income kids in Los Angeles or DesMoines find food and shelter for thedevastated of Darfur or Biloxi so wehave a rather stark division among us
the most fortunate volunteer for thenon-military the less fortunatevolunteer for the military and those inbetween the vast majority of Americansdo neither because they can't afford to
I know for a fact I would not havevoluntarily gone into the Marine Corps50 years ago I would have gone directlyfrom my commencement ceremony to a jobto my job that I already had as a
newspaper reporter which is what I didthree years later after my service trustmeI was a much better reporter thenbecause of how I spent those intervening
three years and a much better person andeven commencement speaker now fiftyyears later the bottom line for me onthis is simply this whatever theultimate conclusion I believe
passionately that we would all benefitfrom a full and frank discussion of ourmutual responsibilities to serve of thejoys and satisfactions that come from
such service from lifting ourselves awayfrom our own needs just for a whileto pay attention to those of others andof trying to find a way that involves
every one of us I am well aware of thecollateral debates that would mostlikely spring from this one one has todo with going to war national servicewith a military option would complicate
decisions of presidents and congressesabout using force parents and spousesand children of the potential combatantswould have to be in the loop along with
the volunteer experts the pundits thepoliticians and the generals some wouldargue that's a good thing because itwould force more public explanations and
justifications and thus harder thinkingbefore rushing off to invade or to bombothers would say that's terrible becausethe result could be a hand wringing
public referendum on every military usedecision our country makes and back andforth and back and forth and so thedebate would go and I say let thatdebate and all others on national
service begin and as they say in othervenues thus ends the rendering of themessagebut let me add very quickly I am NOTurging any of you students alum faculty
members members the administrationparents to run off and join the Marinesand I say that because the one of thefirst major commencement addresses Imade to a college graduating class my
theme then was risk take risks and yourpersonal lives your professional livesand I went on and on about the joys andsatisfactions to be had from arisk-filled life few weeks later phone
rings at our house in Washington aftermidnight it's a young male voice on thephone says mr. Lera you changed my lifehmmI was trying to wake up you said I was
in that graduating class I heard whatyou said about in again yourcommencement address about taking risksmm-hmm I was in the class I had alreadytaken a job on Wall Street but when you
said that about taking risks I changedmy mind and I decided to do what Iwanted to do in the first place anyhowand as soon as the ceremony was over Itold my mom and dad no Wall Street I was
going into the business of makingsunglasses frames with clear plastictubes where you could change the colorwith a little BB like things you wentred white and blue one day pink the next
you want whatever and he said I've doneit mr. lair I'm gonna be on the CBSMorning News tomorrow demonstrating myframes I figured you'd want to knowthank you sir for changing my life now
it was really awake and I was thinkingoh my what had I brought of coursemostly I was thinking that his parentsprobably had a hit on it out on me so inthe unlikely event one of you all does
decide to join the Marines today pick upand go and run and go and do it finesimplify but please just don't tell meabout it for the record I do now know
about my own commencement speaker fiftyyears ago I went to my University'swebsite the other day he was a popularnovelist screenwriter and playwright at
the time so what this means for all ofyou 50 years from now if you want toknow who want to know about thecommencement speaker today you can go towww.petland.com
